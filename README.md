# Cubiomes++

This is a C++ version of [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes), trying to improve performance & readability using modern C++ features (C++ 20 or later).

It is not compatible to the original cubiomes. You have to rewrite your current code in C++.

It is also not compatible to shared library due to **C++ ABI problems**.

This project is still under development but I will try to keep this library up-to-date.

Feel free make a pull request if you want to help.
